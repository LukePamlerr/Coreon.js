# Security Practices for Coreon.js

## Introduction

At Coreon.js, we prioritize the security of our framework and its users. This document outlines our security practices and provides guidance on how to report security vulnerabilities.

## Secure Coding Practices

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
2. **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
3. **Authorization**: Ensure proper authorization checks are in place for sensitive operations.
4. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest using industry-standard algorithms.
5. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages. Use generic error messages for users.

## Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies to their latest stable versions to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like `npm audit` to identify and fix vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Security Testing

- Implement automated security testing in your CI/CD pipeline.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
